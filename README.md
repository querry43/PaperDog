Paper Dog
=========

Design Process
--------------
We started by reviewing pictures of different dog breeds.  It came down to:
* English Bulldog
* Basset Hound
* Welsh Corgi
* Newfoundland

We went with the English Bulldog.

To get the robot shape, we printed out some images to draw on.

Those got scanned in and redrawn in inkscape and ultimately turned into a 1:1
scale printout.
